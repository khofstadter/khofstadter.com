My personal website.

- add szinusz podcast
- sync cv, website and linkedin

## system
- sort out bundle, gemfile and sitemap issue
- do we need Google Analytics? if yes, maybe .info needs to be changed to .com
- do we need disqus?
- add related links part to each post

## todo
- add filter to group posts where related links need to be displayed;
- flyers missing in MPA research organising post

## tag filter
<!-- this comment could not be kept in the index file: 

<div id="tags" class="tabcontent"> 
{% include index-tags.html %}
</div> 


-->

## content
- add 140 short for each contineu with EDM music production;
- think about associate lecturing content
  - (move from subdomains of tedor.info);
  - in the past list have links to only outcomes as content/syllabus has change/got better so there should be only one page for each module;
### music
- add cherry blossoms to bandcamp
- add 2nd theatre music to bancamp

## design
- how do I organise quotes - each should have another file or can they be together and anchored?
- add svg files as variable with variables in CSS with https://css-tricks.com/using-svg/;
- use scss or css instead of sass;
- use HSLA colours;
- maybe use google fonts or https://www.fontsquirrel.com/
- use @fontface?
- RSS: https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/convert-site-to-jekyll/#10-rss-feed
- tinyletter vs MailChimp;


- add hyperlinks to associate lecturing and maybe a picture;
- essex workhops: summarise feedback.
* migrate info from stech.tedor.info and m4mi.tedor.info subdomains to a page;
then redirect these subdomains in htaccess;
backup all files with FTP;
then transfer this domain to namecheap;
email address needs sorting as well;


r faster editing posts, perhaps we should reset all browser settings: adding line breaks with <br><br> makes to code look cluttered, experiment with
Wired craft style;

add content:
- teaching:
- stech2011 find a picture (pictures) of student outcomes;
- stech2014 find a picture (pictures) of student outcomes and video;
- clean up laptop performance;
index list could have a collapsible or accordion like info below the date and title; when clicking on the title the new info should be revealed, where there is a 'read more' button that opens up the post or external page;

migrate from tedor.info:
- 2dvisual art (photography as well?)
- some events remaining;
- teaching (earlier teaching from index could link to archive in main teaching page - subdomain or no subdomain?)
- employment and education;
- linked in recommendations;
how to add info to index without linking to a post;
posts: load text, image, then JS (load Bandcamp without Artwork, add jpg file separate)

- add alt text to all /assets/img/;
- check accessibility of pages;
