short: A music release interpreting stories from my 'secret place', a special state of mind.
---

 Secret Place is a safe place, which I have discovered around the age of 18 in Somberek, the village where I grew up. The first attempt to express insights discovered in this state of mind was manifested in poetry (Titkos hely, 2005). This release is a musificaion of this state of mind.

The release has an eclectic choice in style consisting of my works and remixes by friends.
