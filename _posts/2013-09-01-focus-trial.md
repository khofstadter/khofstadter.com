Compositions made with _Focus_ prototype, a sequencer capable of generating random musical patterns: pitch, volume, duration of sound and duration between sounds. The sequencer was developed in SuperCollider 3.6 for my MA dissertation titled 'The development of software for auditory display incorporating principles of generative music and neuro-feedback training'.
