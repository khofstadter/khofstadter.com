short: In this AHRC funded project, we sought to explore how sound design techniques can be used to rethink accessibility to film and television for visually impaired audiences. The research included the application of surround sound rendering, interactive media systems and first person narration. My key responsibilities were organising events, engagement with organisations and participants, qualitative and quantitative data analysis, web-design and maintenance, photography, audio-video production and co-authoring journal papers.
