 A whole day workshop in the [Somberek Culture House](http://www.somberek.hu/muvhaz.htm) for children focusing on rhythm and creativity with sound. We have used a variety of everyday tools to make sounds, Logic Pro for recording and replaying sounds. Some of the games we played when making the sounds or using the sounds made have incorporated elements from music therapy practices.

With József Egervári ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/mpontmost/videos)) and Éva Pénzes.
