<p>First of all, why do we compose music? If we compose music because something inspired us, what is the difference between the inspiration being another piece of music, a painting or literature for instance poetry?</p>

<p>Letâ€™s start with an exercise:</p>

<ol>
  <li>read all haikus below</li>
  <li>listen to the compositions</li>
  <li>try to match a haiku to a composition</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>My Life;-<br />
How much more of it remains?<br />
The night is brief.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nude Beach<br />
Nothing New<br />
Under The Sun</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Depths, Swelling Green<br />
Leviathan Walks, Waves Break<br />
Cold Sleet, it is here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The wind of war<br />
Blowing across my face<br />
The thunder roaring loudly</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An SSBN<br />
Moves silently through the deep -<br />
Five knots to nowhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tremble, oh my gravemound,<br />
in time my cries will be<br />
only this autumn wind</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<p>What was similar in these compositions?
Are the haikus compositions?
What does it mean to compose?
What was different?
Would you have interpreted poems in similar ways into music?
Now, that you have heard an example of someoneâ€™s interpretation, is your imagination guided in a certain way?</p>

<ul>
  <li>So what is an imaginary soundscape? How can we compose one?</li>
  <li>Read the poems, choose one.</li>
  <li>Close your eyes and imagine the happenings, pictures, movements. There might be animals, humans, machines, nature, synthetic sounds, abstract sounds, conversations, real environmentsâ€¦ Hear and listen to their sounds. What is the difference between hearing and listening?</li>
  <li>Capture the emotional content, rhythm, pace, form.</li>
  <li>Use a pen and paper, draw a picture or a map. Imagine moving inside your new world, listen.</li>
  <li>Think about the relationship of your objects, compare them to each other, find differences and similarities in the way they look, feel, sound.</li>
  <li>Make sound recordings of voice, traditional instruments, synthesise sounds, use sound libraries as well as DSP (Digital Signal Processing) e.g. filtering, panning, reverb, delayâ€¦ to create a palette of objects, the building blocks of your new world.</li>
  <li>Analyse the waveform of a poemâ€™s sound recording. There might be a picture in there e.g.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Organise these objects into a composition so that it has a flow, where the listener can immerse in a journey inside your <em>imaginary soundscape</em>. In other words, create a narrative, a story.</li>
  <li>Use detailed musical expressions, nuances, to guide the listener. Incorporate appropriate music theory.</li>
  <li>Think about space, acoustics, the movement of the listener vs. movement of listenerâ€™s focus. What is the difference?</li>
</ul>

<p>Any other ideas?</p>

<p>To understand the difference between these, can help us get closer to a creative state of mind as well. In this video Pauline touches on some very interesting ideas:</p>
