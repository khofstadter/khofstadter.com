<h2 id="the-plot">the plot</h2>

<p>â€˜Three teenagers trapped on the Isle of Wight, desperate to make their mark on the world. But is the pull of the past too strong? Under starry skies and seaside lights, Jack, Lucy and Milly are spending their summer working in a greasy seaside cafÃ©. Behind the banter, bravado and occasional hangover, the three teens struggle with past heartache, disconnection and anxiety about a future they just canâ€™t seem to start living.â€™</p>
