From Ellisif's email:

Throughout COP26 (and beyond) UCU members have collaborated with the Sustainability team to put together a range of events to learn about and discuss the climate and ecological crisis and the various responses to it. 

Events range from talks and workshops to nature walks and a climate cafe where we can come together to share our grief, anger or anxieties about the climate and ecological emergency. You can find the full programme of events here (note that some events have yet to be included): https://linktr.ee/uoesus and here https://www.essex.ac.uk/events?page=1&organiser=sustainability 

I would like to draw your attention, in particular, to the lunchtime talks we are having in our Green Speaker's Corner on Square 2 from the 1st to the 10th November. Please bring your lunch outside, tell your students and join in the conversation. Each lunchtime event will last for about 30 minutes.

On some days, there will also be stalls by various environmental organisations. If you would like to give a lunchtime talk, we still have some slots available. 

We hope to see you over the next two weeks for these crucial discussions on sustainability and our future.
