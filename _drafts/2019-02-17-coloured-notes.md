## log

- have been using the 4 BIC pen for a while in the paper notebook: black (normal), blue (link/connection/relationship - like a html link), green (personal/dream/comments), red (important)
- this system shoudl be used in my pdf note taking as well, however, there is no black as the text is in black, previously I used this

![prev. colour coding](../assets/images/pdf-colour-coding-01.jpg)

new for research paper/books, etc: 

yellow: reuse/paraphrase  
green: personal  
blue: external link (perhaps of interest) 
red: imporant  
purple: to check
