new-date: Jun 2013

 My 'secret place' is an ASC that I discovered at the age of 18 in Somberek, the village where I grew up. The first attempt to express insights from the ASC were manifested in the poem '[titkos hely'](https://poet.hu/vers/27294) in 2005. This 'secret place ' music release takes the experiment, the interpretation further with musificaion.

The release has an eclectic choice in style consisting of my works and remixes by friends.
